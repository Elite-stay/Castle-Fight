  Elementals
    Elementals are the oldest race that exists from the very formation of the universe. Elementals' units are quite strong, but at the same time rather expensive. Elementals use element control to defeat their enemies and strengthen the Allied army with strong magic. This unique race can reduce unit training time. The race has a defensive tower.
